		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<hr>

		<h2>Background</h2>

		<h3><i>Then</i></h1>

		<p>I've always loved art. All through grade school, art was always my favorite class and I loved to draw and paint in my free time. As I got older, my love for art never changed, however, I knew I couldn't make it as a freelance artist. I need my work to have a much greater purpose than pure aesthetic. I need to be assigned tasks that challenge me to think in new and different ways. I need to work in a collaborative and stimulating environment where I can be inspired and continue to learn every day. </p>

		<p>Towards the end of my senior year in high school, I was interning for the owner of a local yoga studio. At this time, I had no idea what my career path would be, but I liked yoga and thought it’d be interesting to learn about how a small business operates. One day, the owner asked me to design a few posters. I loved the process and she loved the outcome! I was then assigned to design different retail items for the company that I still see people using. It’s the most rewarding feeling knowing that people are gaining something from my artwork. Through this internship, I received so much clarity and realized what I wanted to spend the rest of my life doing. For the very first time, I knew I wanted to work in marketing and advertising.</p>

		<h3><i>Now</i></h1>

		<p>As a sophomore communications student at Elon University, I have acquired skills in strategic thinking, writing, and designing. I’m very familiar with CS6 and I’ve learned how to combine aesthetics with functionality by making intentional design choices of color, typography, and composition as applicable to my projects. I understand how each design component can influence a person’s perceptions, so I’m attentive to detail for each and every choice that I make.	</p>

		<p><b>My life-long passion for art and curiosity for understanding the human psyche have driven me towards the field of marketing and advertising.</b></p>
